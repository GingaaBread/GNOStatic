features:
  - title: 😻 Simplified Object-Orientation
    details: |
      GNO was designed to eliminate the typical 'writing mania' of many object-orientated
      languages, in which getter & setter methods, constructors, protection levels, equality methods,
      and so on often need to be manually written by the programmer. Every single time.
  - title: 📖 Readable & Beginner Friendly
    details: |
      In GNO, there is a strong focus on readability, making the language very 
      beginner-friendly. Keywords are preferred over operators, and _new_ keywords are introduced as
      that sweet, sweet syntactic sugar.
  - title: 🚧 Concise & Safe Code
    details: |
      GNO is a very safe language. As it already knows the type of each variable at compile time,
      it can help prevent errors before they happen. On top of that, you can easily add custom 
      checks to your code that assert conditions that the code must meet. And of course, 
      if you don't want to, a variable will never be null 😏
