# Print Builtin Method

The `print` method is a builtin method that allows users to print a string to the console,
followed by the new line character `\n`.

It works analogously to using `printin` and appending `\n` at the end.

As a builtin method, the method parenthesis are optional.

## Example

```gno
print "Hello World!"
print "This is in a new line!"

print("Hello World!")
print("This is in a new line!   ")
```
