tagline: A statically typed, object-oriented, high-level, general-purpose programming language

features:
  - title: ðŸ˜» Simplified Object-Orientation
    details: |
      GNO was designed to eliminate typical boilerplate code that comes with traditional
      object-orientated languages. Type inference is introduced to variables, methods, and 
      encapsulation has been rethought. Line ends are preferred over semi-colons.
  - title: ðŸ“– Readable & Beginner Friendly
    details: |
      In GNO, there is a strong focus on readability, making the language very 
      beginner-friendly. Keywords are preferred over operators, and new keywords are introduced as
      that sweet syntactic sugar.
  - title: ðŸš§ Concise & Safe Code
    details: |
      GNO is a very safe language. As it already knows the type of each variable at compile time,
      it can help prevent errors before they happen. Assertions can be used comfortably.
